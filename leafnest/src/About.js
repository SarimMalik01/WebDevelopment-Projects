          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2023 , LeafNest was born from a simple idea:
            to make homes greener and lives better. We started small, selling a few hand-picked plants to friends and family. 
            Today, we've grown into a thriving community dedicated to sustainability and the joys of gardening.
